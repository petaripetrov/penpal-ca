Baseline (Memory Condition): Expected score â‰ˆ 7.78
No-Memory Condition: Expected score is 0.71 points lower than the memory condition, but this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.114).
Language Variability: There is notable variability between languages, which is captured by a group variance of 1.103.

In essence, while there is a trend toward lower scores without memory support, the evidence is not strong enough to conclude that the memory condition has a significant overall effect on word recall when accounting for language differences.
